## My Strategy

* My goal was to ensure the information was easy to access while striving for a responsive and elegant design.

## Structure

* I wanted the landing page to be fairly minimalistic and elegant but also make it easy for the user to quickly get straight to the main purpose and service of the site.

// Insert Link to Screenshot

* From the landing page the user can scroll manually down to reveal the wine pairing service, or they can click on the "wine pairing" link in the Navbar
* Links to the Contact and Shop Local are also in the Navbar and from each of those two pages the user can easy navigate back to the home/landing page area and the pairing wines service area and either the contact or shop local page, depending on which page the user is on.

## UI 
* My design choices were based on the owner goals of communicating a feeling of elegance and simplicity and the user goals of wanting to quickly access and make use of the sites main services.
* I went with a pallette of slightly offwhite text juxtaposed against a dark background with thin offred borders.
* For the main sections I went with the same color combinations playing light against dark with semi-transparent backgrounds over vibrantly colored images of various fruits, cheeses and wine.
* My design choices in the main sections were based on maintaining a feeling of elegance, simplicity, but also a sense of occasion... to make every day, Gourmet!

* Fonts I chose are:
  * <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat/" target="_blank">Montserrat</a> with a font-weight of 300. I used this font for all the text content on the site except for the word 'Gourmet' the 'C' in the 'close' button at the bottom of the wine suggestion modal and the names of the three wines returned as a suggestion to the user.
  * <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yellowtail/" target="_blank">Yellowtail</a> used for the word 'Gourmet' and the 'C' in the 'close' button at the bottom of the wine suggestion modal.
  * <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora" target="_blank">Lora</a> used only to style the names of the wine suggestions returned from the wine pairing service.

## Features

* Automated wine pairing service: allows the User to select a food type and get a suggestion for three types of wines to pair with their selection, the information returned includes buttons with the text 'Shop' which include links to the types of wines suggested which will open in a new tab and take the user to wine.com with a search having already been performed for the specific type of wine they clicked "shop" on.
* Email service: allows the User to contact the site owner.
* Shop locally service: allows the User to do a search for 'wines near me' or in reality anything the User might wish to search for in relation to google.maps allowed searches.

## Scope

* The current scope of the project is limited, users have a limited number of food selection options. The reason for this is simply due to the nature of the project, the level of my current coding skills, and the limited time to complete the project. I didn't want to overcommit myself and so I kept the scope of the project within what I felt was currenty achievable.
