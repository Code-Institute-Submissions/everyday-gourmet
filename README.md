## Structure

* The main site is structured as a one page website scrolling over a fixed background image with a sticky footer
* Navigation links at the top left of the page 


* The landing page features the Band Logo front and center with the Band name image fading in 


* The smooth scrolling overlap feature and fixed background images are disabled on smaller devices and the site reverts to a single page long scroll site at a width of 1024px
* There is a Navigation bar at the top of the site - This bar is fixed and does not dissapear when scrolling - The Navigation bar collapses on smaller devices and a button appears which gives access to the Nav-Links on smaller devices
* Users can navigate to each section on the site by clicking the appropriate link within the Navigation bar - The buttons/links are designated by name corresponding to their respective sections
* Users can also scroll through the site by clicking on the small down facing chevrons located at the bottom of each section.

## **Interactions that are fully functional include:**
1. The Local Site Navigation links located in the Navigation Bar fixed at the top of the site - These links also function on smaller devices and are accessed via the Toggle at the top right of the screen
1. The Social Media links in the sidebar which are linked to external sites
1. Links to open Modals (a small overlay box with content)
1. Links to close Modals
1. All scrolling chevrons
1. All 'Tickets' links are functional but currently click through to https://www.ticketmaster.com

## **Areas where a link or interaction will not function as intended:**

1. The 'Get my free download' in the Call to Action modal. The modal can be opened by clicking on the ! Free Download of our latest Album !.
1. The 'Send project request' in the Lets Work Together modal in the 'Contact' section.
1. The 'Sign Up' button in the form at the bottom of the 'Contact' section.

### **No form submit actions will work and will simply reload the page.**
### **This is because this is a static site with no backend currently.**

Testing during development

** The site was found to run slowly on a Huawei P20 lite
** The site was found to run without issue on a  Xiaomi mi 9
